# IPLog
Simple Discord IP Logger written in JS and HTML
# Setup
Get a web hosting, for example 000webhost, upload the contents here and change the webhook link in index.html
# Remember
This is a shit logger, i would rather use Grabify or SniffIP to be honest, this repository is useless unless u have a domain, + everyone can view your webhook.
